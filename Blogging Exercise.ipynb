    "A great way to build your skills, portfolio, and online presence as a data scientist is to regularly play with new datasets and publish interesting observations you have made. Every Monday morning, you'll be examining a dataset of your choosing in order to practice this skill. Below are a series of questions to get you started. You may use this notebook as a template to complete the exercise every week.\n",

    "For this exercise, you are highly encouraged to use a 'fresh' dataset like one featured in [Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/).  \n",

    "\n",
    "Every monday, slack the dataset you have chosen to Ben by 10 am. You are required to examine a different dataset every week.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to write 10 blog posts. At least 3(?) of them, and no more than 6(?) must explore interesting datasets.\n",
